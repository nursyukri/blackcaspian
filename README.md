#Contract Separation#
The BlackCaspian EuroT token is not a single smart contract; instead, it is separated into three cooperating contracts.

ERC20Proxy
This contract exposes the functions required by the ERC20 standard, and is the only contract with which a user will need to interact with. It is the permanent interface to the BlackCaspian EuroT.

ERC20Impl
This contract encapsulates all the logic of the BlackCaspian EuroT token. ERC20Proxy delegates all execution of ERC20 functions to its trusted instance ERC20Impl.

ERC20Store
This contract owns the storage of the BlackCaspian EuroT ledger. Calls to the update functions on ERC20Store are limited to its trusted instance of ERC20Impl.

Custodianship
Each smart contract in the BlackCaspian EuroT system looks to a custodian for approval of important actions. This custodian may be another smart contract or a keyset (online or offline).

CustodianUpgradeable
This contract provides re-usable code for custodianship and provision for passing the custodian role. All of ERC20Proxy, ERC20Impl, and ERC20Store inherit from this contract. This contract itself inherits from LockRequestable, which provides a cooperatively universally unique identifier generation scheme.

Custodian
This contract provides general-purpose custodianship designed to be backed by an offline keyset. Approval requires dual control; time lock and revocation features are also provided.

Upgradeability
The logical separation between the exposed ERC20 interface (ERC20Proxy), contract state (ERC20Store), and token logic (ERC20Impl) allows for upgradeability.

ERC20ImplUpgradeable
This contract provides re-usable code for replacing the active token logic: the active instance of ERC20Impl. It itself inherits from CustodianUpgradeable as the upgrade process is controlled by the custodian. Both ERC20Proxy and ERC20Store inherit from this contract.

Control of the Token Supply
Management of the token supply demands the security of an offline approval mechanism yet the flexibility of an online approval mechanism.

PrintLimiter
This contract provides custodianship of ERC20Impl to govern increases to supply of BlackCaspian EuroT tokens, with an offline approval mechanism granting limited privileges to an online approval mechanism.
